# CEF Data Marketplace
https://www.datamarketplace.eu

CEF Data Marketplace aims to develop a broader market serving the data needs of all stakeholders in the global translation space, across various desired language combinations and domains. It focuses on the development of a universal, secure language data trading platform that will open up a continuous and long-term supply of language data for machine translation and other machine learning applications.

The project is linked to the European Language Resource Coordination ELRC-share index for language tools, and the marketplace software will be shared under open-source licenses.
