      <p>
        <span>
          2.1 The Parties recognize the importance that only data of good quality is uploaded to the Data Marketplace.
          This means that the Seller has familiarized itself with the Language Data and makes sure that it will only
          contribute Language Data which has, at some moment in time, undergone a human review and/or signoff. The
          Seller is the data controller in respect of the PII in the Language Data it contributes and TAUS will provide
          data anonymization tools to assist Seller in satisfying data protection law requirements. TAUS must not
          knowingly use Language Data that contains PII which Seller is not permitted to share as per applicable (data
          protection) laws.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>

          2.2 When contributing Language Data, Seller grants TAUS a non-exclusive, royalty-based, worldwide license to
          use the Language Data in connection with the Data Marketplace. Seller may terminate this license at any time
          by providing TAUS with prior written notice of 60 (sixty) days. For clarity, this license includes data
          processing such as the clustered search, known as the Matching Data service, cleaning and anonymization.

      <p>
        <span>
          2.3 Upon discovery, by either Party, that the Language Data contains Proprietary Information or other
          information which Seller is obligated to not disclose, the discovering Party shall immediately inform the
          other Party of such discovery. TAUS shall cooperate fully with Seller in retrieving and removing such
          information from the Language Data, and shall endeavor to keep such information confidential and prevent such
          information from being accessed via the Data Marketplace.

          2.4 Seller hereby grants to TAUS a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-based license to use, copy, modify and
          merge the Language Data in connection with the Data Marketplace until termination of the license. Upon
          termination of the license, howsoever arising, TAUS will unpublish the Language Data. In the context of this
          article, &lsquo;to unpublish&rsquo; means that the Language Data will be made unavailable to third parties on
          the Data Marketplace from the date of unpublishing, without having retroactive effect. As a result, and from
          the date of unpublishing the Language Data, TAUS will no longer make use of the license referred to in the
          first sentence of this Article, with the exception of storage of the Language Data on the Database, for which
          no consideration will be due.

          Language Data from the legacy TAUS Data Cloud to the new Data Marketplace and in the Human Language Project
          portal where TAUS hires the services of freelance workers to translate corpora for low-resource languages and

      <p>
        <span>
          4.1 The Data Marketplace will trade the data at the segment level. Sellers set prices for their data by
          choosing a value per 1000 words. That information will be used to define the data segment price. The price of
          one data set will be the sum of its segments. Sellers also will be paid for single segments that are sold as
          result of clustered search (Matching Data).
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>

        <span>
          5.1 &#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;TAUS shall own the rights to the Database and any updates
          of the Database, it being understood that TAUS shall have no rights in the Language Data other than those
          under the use rights granted under Section 2 of this agreement. Seller indicates upon submitting the Language
          Data whether the Seller owns the Intellectual Property Rights to the Language Data, acts on behalf of the
          owner of the Intellectual Property Rights (Article 6.1) or submits Language Data that are free of Intellectual
          Property Rights. The Seller does not grant TAUS, without the prior written consent from the trademark owner,
          the right to use any such trademarks. Furthermore, TAUS exclusively owns all rights in any ideas, concepts,
          know-how, documentation, techniques with respect to the Data Marketplace and associated technology (other than

      </p>
      <p><span class="font-bold">6. Infringements</span></p>
      <p>
        <span>
          6.1 Seller shall have the first right, but not the obligation, to bring any action to prevent or terminate any
          infringement, misappropriation or other unauthorized use of the Intellectual Property Rights licensed to TAUS
          under these Conditions. Within fifteen (15 days) of any notice from TAUS of any such infringement,
          misappropriation, or other unauthorized use, Seller shall notify TAUS whether Seller will bring any such
          action. If any such action is brought by Seller, Seller shall have full control over the prosecution and
          settlement or compromise of such action and shall assume all the expenses and be entitled to all proceeds in
          respect of such action provided that TAUS shall have the opportunity to review and comment in advance on any
          material substantive filings or proceedings in such action. TAUS, at Seller&rsquo;s expense, shall fully
          cooperate with and assist Seller in such action and shall be the nominal plaintiff or join as a co-plaintiff
          if and to the extent required by applicable law or requested by Seller.

          6.2 &#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;If Seller in its discretion elects not to pursue any
          action against a suspected infringer, Seller will notify TAUS whereupon TAUS may notify Seller of its desire
          to pursue such action in its own name. If the possible infringement can reasonably be expected to have
          material adverse effect on TAUS if no action is taken with respect to the possible infringement, Seller shall
          permit TAUS, at its sole expense, to proceed in its own name with the prosecution of any action with respect
          to stopping the possible infringement, provided that Seller shall have the right to participate in such
          action, at its own expense, shall have the opportunity to review and comment in advance on any material
          substantive filings or proceedings in such action, and shall approve of any settlement of any such action,
          which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          6.3 Notwithstanding the above, Seller shall have the final decision with regard to bringing or proceeding with
          such action. If Seller, in its sole discretion, determines that such action would not be in the best interest
          of Seller, Seller shall notify TAUS of such determination, whereupon TAUS shall not bring such action against
          Suspected Infringer, or if such action has commenced, to terminate such action.

      </p>
      <p><span class="font-bold">7. Representations and Warranties of Seller</span></p>

          foregoing, TAUS will notify the Seller of each such amendment by email to such email address as shall be
          agreed upon by the Parties. Any continued use of the Data Marketplace by User will subsequently constitute

          11.5 &#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;In the event that one or more provisions of these
          Conditions should be determined to be null and void or non-binding by an arbitral tribunal or court having
          competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of these Conditions will continue to be effective. In such case,
          the Parties are obliged to replace the non-binding provisions with other provisions that are binding, in such
          a way that the intended economic result of the new provisions differs as little as possible from the intended
          economic result of the original provisions, taking into account the object and the purpose of these
          Conditions. If a part or parts of the Conditions rendered void, invalid or unenforceable substantially impair
          the value of the whole Conditions to any Party, such Party may cancel and terminate the Conditions by giving
          written notice to the other Party.
